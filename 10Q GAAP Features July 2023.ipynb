    "# GAAP Features Report July 2023 \n",
    "**This report details GAAP data collection efforts through 07/17/2023.** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The GAAP Features source code library processes all raw SEC 10-Q filing document collections extracting the filing's XBRL instance document and all XBRL facts disclosed by the filer. The XBRL instance document typically references multiple taxonomies such as the US-GAAP taxonomy that define the numerous individual XBRL facts contained within the instance document.  Each fact typically contains one piece of digital data (the value) and all of the associated metadata (name, data type, decimal places, debit / credit, USD, shares, ratio, text block, labels, taxonomy url, namespace etc) that define the fact's value. One fact can contain any number of metadata elements defined in its taxonomy definition.  One filing may reference the US-GAAP taxonomy and any other number of other taxonomies containing fact specific definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC filings use XBRL facts to disclose filing metadata, report text blocks, fiscal duration data, fiscal instance data, share data, ratio data, filing flags, and other filing specific information. The GAAP Features library processes XBRL facts and uses the filing specific metadata to organize and create filing and fact specific views for all of the data disclosed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiscal instance and duration data contain all financial assets, income, cash flows, and balance sheet data included within each filing. The library uses both instance and duration data to identify common accounting periods and financial disclosures contained within 10-Q filings such as: quarter over quarter, year over year, YTD over YTD, document / fiscal period ending, and fiscal year ending financial performance results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once fiscal instance and duration records are categorized and matched, percentage changes may also be determined for financial performance elements disclosed across multiple fiscal instances or durations.  For example, two fiscal durations make up the current quarterly results (duration 1) for a filer and the same period for the prior year (duration 2).  Percentage changes for any XRBL fact disclosed in both fiscal durations, such as gross income, can be determined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The current library calculates percentage changes for all financial items disclosed in Year over Year quarterly durations (QoQ), fiscal YTD over YTD durations (YoY), and the fiscal year end instant over document period ending instant (FYED to DPED).    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Library Functionality and Coverages\n",

    "* **Year-over-Year Quarterly Fiscal Durations (QoQ):** Compares a given quarter's data with the same quarter from the previous year. For example, you could compare Q2 2023 with Q2 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **YTD over YTD (Year-to-Date) Durations (YoY):** Compares the cumulative total for a given fiscal year up until a certain date with the cumulative total for the previous year up until the same date. For example, you could compare YTD as of Q2 2023 with YTD as of Q2 2022.\n",

    "In a perfect world, the dates or durations for two QoQ or YoY / YTD durations would match.  However, this is certainly NOT the case in practice.  For example, a current QoQ duration may cover 90 days and the prior year may cover 93 days etc.  Start and end dates may also be off by a few days. Furthermore, matching durations may not always disclose the exact same financial data elements.   \n",
